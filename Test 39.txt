While some view it as an act of vandalism others argue that it is a valuable form of artistic expression. In this article we will explore the reasons why graffiti should be acknowledged as a legitimate art form and discuss its impact on culture and society. Graffiti has its roots in urban culture and emerged as a form of self expression in the 1970s in New York City. At that time marginalized communities used graffiti to make their voices heard. It provided an outlet for individuals who felt excluded from the traditional art scene allowing them to express their creativity and opinions in public spaces. Graffiti became synonymous with urban culture and served as a powerful means of reclaiming public spaces. It allowed communities to take control of their environment and express their identity. One of the reasons why graffiti should be considered as art is its ability to reflect the social issues faced by communities. Many graffiti artists use this medium to shed light on topics such as racism inequality and political injustice. By painting murals and tagging walls they bring attention to these matters and stimulate conversations among the public. Graffiti can act as a visual protest challenging the status quo and forcing viewers to confront uncomfortable truths. It has the power to break down barriers and engage people in important discussions about social justice. Moreover graffiti has the power to transform blighted areas into vibrant and colourful spaces. Neglected walls and buildings can be transformed into works of art through the skilful use of spray paint. This revitalization not only brings beauty to the surrounding environment but also has a positive impact on local communities. Studies have shown that neighbourhoods with well executed graffiti art experience reduced crime rates and an increase in community pride. By transforming these spaces street artists contribute to the overall improvement of the urban landscape."
